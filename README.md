Welcome to my To Do List Application! The following is a very simple application that allows a user to create their own To Do List. Some of the features of this application include: Adding Tasks, Removing Tasks, Viewing the list of tasks with status of 'Incomplete' or 'Complete', Marking a task as 'Complete', and Quitting the application once the user is finished. One note is that when a task is added to the To Do List, it is automatically given the status of 'Incomplete' until the user marks that task as Complete. To Run the application, all you need to do is press the play button for the Terminal, and you will instantly be brought to the Main Menu where you can select from multiple different options of what you would like to do. The program has been tested for incorrect user input or input of any option other than those on the main menu, as well as case sensitivity for tasks given by the user. Hope you enjoy, and thank you!
