Hi there, and welcome to my Contact Management Application! 
This is a very simple yet robust contact application that lets the user have control over a contact list that they themselves create. 
To start, simply run the attached python code in the Terminal, and the program will start from there with a command line menu of options for the user to choose from. 
The options available for the user to choose from include: 
 - Adding a contact by name, phone number, and email
 - Editing an existing contact's name, phone number, or email
 - Removing and existing contact and all associated information
 - Searching for a contact by name, then showing all asssociated information
 - Display current list of contacts, with associating phone number and email
 - Export contact list and all information to a .txt file
 - Import .txt file written from exported file

The application also includes several error handling methods, such as inccorect input from user, file not found errors, incorrectly formatted phone numbers/emails, etc. 
Hope you enjoy the application, and thank you!
